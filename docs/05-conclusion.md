# Conclusion

In this lab, we learned about APIs, testing, dockerization and CICD pipelines. We joined these components together to allow us to make our APIs available on the internet. This acts as an introduction to understand how to deliver our software products to customers using DevOps methodologies.

## Deliverables

As a deliverable, prepare a single document with your team explaining:

1. Your implementation of the APIs
2. The unit tests you implemented
3. The DockerFile you created
4. PR Pipeline configuration file
5. Merge pipeline configuration file
6. Explanation of your end to end tests
7. Image of your passing pipelines on GitHub

Make sure to add your team number, the student number of all participants and a link to the GitHub repo in the report.
